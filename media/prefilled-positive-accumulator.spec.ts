  // Incase updating an accumulator is expensive like making a blockchain txn, a cheaper strategy
  // is to add the members to the accumulator beforehand but not giving out the witnesses yet.
  // Eg. accumulator manager wants to add a million members over an year, rather than publishing
  // the new accumulator after each addition, the manager can initialize the accumulator with a million
  // member ids (member ids are either predictable like monotonically increasing numbers or the manager
  // can internally keep a map of random ids like UUIDs to a number). Now when the manager actually
  // wants to allow a member to prove membership, he can create a witness for that member but the
  // accumulator value remains same and thus the witness for existing members also remain same. It
  // should be noted though that changing the accumulator
  // value causes change in all existing witnesses and thus its better to make a good estimate
  // of the number of members during prefill stage

  // Manager estimates that he will have `total_members` members over the course of time
